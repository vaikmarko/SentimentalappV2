# 🗣️ Voices – how it works

Invite trusted people to share how they see you.

1. Click the ➕ icon or the Share button to create a *voice* file.
2. A unique link is copied to your clipboard – send it to your friend.
3. They can write directly in that file; you'll see it update live.

Create as many voices as you like. Each file is private between you and the person you invited.
