### MentalOS: Global Agent Plan and Validation Brief (Combined)

Preface: MentalOS is designed as a universal, culturally aware self‑discovery OS. All flows and prompts adapt to language, region, and cultural norms; safety resources and consent defaults are localized. Below are two stacked documents: (1) the engineering roadmap, and (2) the professor‑facing validation overview.

## Part 1 — Engineering Roadmap (AGENT_ROADMAP)

See `MentalOS/AGENT_ROADMAP.md` for the authoritative version. Key highlights:
- Context‑as‑code with safe knowledge objects, provenance, history, and “Why” citations that open files and highlight sources.
- Playful guided interviews, folder gating via checkpoints, and voice invitations for partner/friend/therapist perspectives.
- Global readiness: multilingual UI/answers, region‑aware crisis resources, culturally calibrated questions, inclusive consent defaults, and fairness checks across locales.

For full details, open `AGENT_ROADMAP.md`.

## Part 2 — Professor‑Facing Product Overview (Validation)

See `MentalOS/PRODUCT_OVERVIEW_FOR_VALIDATION.md` for the authoritative version. Key highlights:
- What MentalOS is, key experiences (guided reflection, “Why”, multiple perspectives, versioned growth).
- Boundaries and safety, consent and data model (local‑first), and pilot plan for ~80 participants.
- Measures (WHO‑5, PANAS‑SF, optional GAD‑7/PHQ‑9, SCC, RFQ‑8 adapted, alliance metric), weekly check‑ins, and system KPIs.
- Global readiness: multilingual, region‑aware safety, culturally sensitive question sets, accessible UX.
