# MentalOS v2: Simple Redesign Plan

## 🎯 What We're Building
**Visual mind mapping + Claude AI + Friend validation = Magical self-discovery**

Like Cursor makes coding feel magical, we make psychology feel magical.

## 📁 Where We're Building It
**Safe development copy**: `/apps/mental-os-v2/`
- Copy of existing system - safe to experiment
- Replace `apps/mental-os-v2/src/App.jsx` with mind map interface
- Integrate Claude API into existing `app.py` 
- Keep `apps/mental-os/` as backup/reference

## 🚀 8-Week Plan
### Week 1-2: Foundation
- Switch GPT → Claude in `app.py`
- Build mind map visualization in `apps/mental-os/src/`
- Replace forms with natural conversation

### Week 3-4: Core Magic
- Pattern recognition: "I notice you mention X often"
- Friend perspectives: Share link → get external viewpoints
- Copy/paste import: Easy data integration

### Week 5-8: Test & Polish
- Deploy to 100 university students
- Measure: 70% weekly usage, "this is magical" feedback
- Iterate and launch publicly

## 🎪 The Magic Moments
1. **"I never noticed that pattern!"** - Visual connections reveal insights
2. **"My friend sees me differently!"** - External validation surprises
3. **"This actually understands me!"** - Claude's contextual awareness
4. **"I want to explore more!"** - Progressive discovery hooks users

## 🛠 Technical Approach
- **No new infrastructure** - Use existing `app.py`, `api/`, `apps/mental-os/`
- **No complex file systems** - One plan file (this one)
- **Token efficient** - Clear, simple instructions for any future conversation

**Next: Start with Claude API integration in `app.py`**
